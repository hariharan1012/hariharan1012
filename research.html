                    <p>Once we had a clear knowledge on the expectations, we were able to reach out to the concerned department and talk to them on how they went about aiding the employees with the current system. On gathering
                      all the knowledge we wanted, we defined the information architecture and proceeded to design our idea. </p>

                <h2 class="">The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The client is a leading retail company based in North America, that primarily deals in aftermarket automotive parts and accessories. They are currently revamping their website and making major changes to their business model.
                    Current website does not yield to current market trends, navigation is very complex and hard to understand, bounce rate was at an increase.</p>
                    <img src="img/research/approach1.png" style=""/>
                    <h2 class="">My Approach</h2>
                  <p>Current website does not yield to current market trendsThe first step was to identify where our client
                    was lagging. I performed basic tasks such as heuristic evaluation and competitor benchmarking and
                    identified the areas of improvement. Post this, I proceeded to understand current market trends by
                     referring to several articles and concised my findings. The next phase was to dive and understand the
                     type of customers that existed and what they preferred. </p>
                     <h2 class="">Insight and Next Step</h2>
                   <p>For this process, I referred to several articles and also sent over a questionnaire to the onsite
                     team to understand the user groups and demographs. With the findings in, I was able to put forth
                     recommendations on how the business could proceed with emphasis on scalability such as BOPUS -
                     how customer experience can extend beyond the website to the real world. My research has helped the
                     client to add extra features such as geofencing, Vehicle pickup, chatbot to their current design.
                     This project is currently ongoing. </p>

          <h2 class="">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>   As most enterprise system goes, different aspects of associate medical care were being handled by
            different teams such as Claims, Insurance, Fitness, etc. This meant that associates had to navigate to
             between different apps to perform the function they wanted. The second part to this application was to
             empower the organization to connect with the associates in a more personal level. To understand this
             better, we performed user interviews with different associates(long term employees and freshers) and
             the pain points we identifed in the process were:</p>
             <ul>
               <li>No single point dedicated system for associates to handle their medical information</li>
               <li>An incoherent method of organizing health events with employees</li>
               <li>No level of personalization</li>
             </ul>
              <img src="img/research/challenge2.png" style=""/>
              <h2 class="">My Approach</h2>
            <p>Post interviewing users, we began to compile the various features that users expected and classify them.
              Based on that we were able to arrive at our Information Architecture. Post framing the IA,
              we started to conceptualize our vision. Post a few iterations, we were able to decide on our final design. </p>
               <h2 class="">The Design</h2>
             <p>Our design was to ensure that every associate is able to get access to their most wanted information
               as easily with as less clicks as possible along with a few additions to boost the usage of the app.
               We wanted an application that will not only help associates monitor the status of their claims or
               reimbursment but will also enable the enterprise to
               get a more personal touch with the associate. Features such as: Health Programs, Diet tips and
               Fitness tracker.</p>
               <img class="img-responsive" src="img/research/design2.png" style="margin: auto;"/>
               <h2 class="">The Outcome</h2>
             <p>We proposed our design to a select group of associates and asked for a feedback. Every associate found the idea interesting along with a few suggestions of how they would like to personalize the application more to them. With the necessary changes made we p
               resented our pitch to the Leadership who appreciated our efforts. This application is being currently developed.</p>
